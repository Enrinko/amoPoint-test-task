=Doc's notes for 0.16=
As you noticed, most of this build work was around previous existing events, most of them are affected in their early games
stages... for that reason I highly reccomend test thos event with a fresh game. How ever, you can still play them with a 
previous save...though you probably miss some of the dialogue or even stages. Y using an old save could also generate some
incoherencies in how the event plays out... but it shouldn't break the game...(it shouldn't)

Originally 0.12 and 0.12.1 was going to be only ONE update, but people got angsty so I decided to upload 0.12 (Holidays Only) first, and then add the missing scene, which 0.12.1 has. This scene is the first to have the STATE repercussions
So take it as a sample of how the rest of the scene will play out in the future.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---0.11---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[NEW H-SCENES]
* MARTHA: (BEASTY) DOGGO BASEMENT EVENT (ALTERNATIVE ROUTE) - BLOWJOB (This event was re-evented, but the triggers are the same as before
          So if you already unlocked it, you can replay it in "My Mind" and the alternatve option will be there. You don't miss anything 
          by that, besides the new route, the only thing that changed was the new busts and some grammar fixes.)
                                                                        
* LUCILE: PANTRY EVENT - (This event was remade from scratch, from the intro stage to the free-mode and expanded to add more stages.
          Which are 3 in total: GRAB; GRIND; SEX. To unlock all stages you need to rise both MC's and Lucile ATT and progress in Lucile's 
          Storyline until you have sex with her for the first time.)
* MIA: NIGHT THIGH-JOB - To rise her "curiosity" just use the "Spend the day" with her. (I will be adding more ways to increase her stats later)
          IMPORTANT: To unlock the new scene you need to replay the HJ scene in the bathroom to activate the trigger for the THIGH-JOB.

[CHANGES]
* MIA CURIOSITY: Capped to 25


=Doc's notes for 0.11=
Not much to say about this one, it will feel pretty small because 2 of the new scenes are additions and remades of already implemented
events. I fixed some minor bugs and corrected a few lines of dialogue, but there's still a lot of grammatical errors that I will be fixing
along the way once I keep rebuilding old events with the new state system.
I was going to impplement the VELVET/JULES PT.2 Event in 0.11, but because that event will involve 2 or more H-scenes (and because of the time
I already took in the other 3 scenes) I decided to add them to 0.12. With that and the (late) Christmas special event, 0.12 will feel a little
bigger than this one.

=Doc's notes for 0.10= !!!PLEASE READ!!!
Now, I know this took a lot of time, but I had a lot of planning to do and a lot of "thinking ahead". Mainly because of the new system
introduced. The GIRL'S STATES will serve as a way to generate routes and outcomes for future scenes and, of course, the SEVERAL endings
I have planned. It will also change the dialogues for all girls depending on their state, and the cloth options. This however, could not
be implemented in this update, because of the large amount of code editing, dialogue writing and art I have to do, So I decided to do it step 
by step across builds. This will help me to get the dialogues right, and that all of this does no feel rushed or out of a bad porn script.
So that said... keep in mind that after the STATES event for each girl, the old scenes will stay the same, because I didn'tmess with
that yet, but in the next build a lot of things will change, like, positions, dialogues, art, and overall experience with each girl.
Thanks for waiting for this update, now go have a fappy time.

* MIA: EVE BATH HJ.

[CHANGES]
* MC DEPRAVATION: Capped to 60.
* LUCILE TRUST: Capped to 55.
* DIARY UPDATED: Now it has a MIA page, once she is in the manor.

Doc' Notes:
At first sight this does not seem like a big update, but letme tell you, it has a lot of art, some your will see, some is a base for
future events. I also "struggled" a little big the "Dress-up" events, i had to try a few things to make it all work, but in the end
everything turn up great.... I think.

Bones' Notes: 
A better delayed from normal schedule, but, having in mind last month atrocious delay, this is just a 
collateral damage. I should be able to get back on track now.
Also, keep in mind that if you do not have enabled the "B" option at the beginning of the game, you will only be able to unlock
scenes in this build.

Bones's Notes:
Overall, this was a great update, A lot of work in the fundation code, a lot of art. I did have the Graphic Tablet issue, wich make me miss a few days fo work, thus the delay.
i hope next updates will have even more scenes implemented each time, I don't dare to speak in numbers just yet, I have to try and see how much I can push in everytime.
But, with most of the code optimazed, I have more time for the story. So, stay tuned.
